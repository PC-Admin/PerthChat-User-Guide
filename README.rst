What should I do after logging in?
==================================

- Join some rooms! Or create your own.

- Add an email or phone number for recovery.

- Clean up your device keys in settings, logging in by browser can generate too many e2e keys.

You can also type in other known homeservers here.


I joined an encrypted room and now i'm being asked to verify?
=============================================================

Ideally end-to-end encryption requires users to verify each others keys, although this isn't strictly required.

Follow the prompts to create a 'secure backup', save this password. Then 'cross-sign' your devices against each other, this creates a web of trust and allows you to recover e2ee messages from previous sessions.

You can then verify other peoples devices in the same way, now you can be certain your messages are headed to the right devices, and not to an intruder who's trying to MITM your conversations.


Can I donate or help?
=====================

Trying to get your friends and family onto the service is helpful. We are also interested in other administrators who want to help us configure custom bridges/integrations/bots for the service.

Matrix.org needs more funding to help develop the Matrix, if you want to support us, consider donating to them:
