Note: If the username you set was ‘Stewo’ then your full Matrix ID would be:

What should I do after logging in?
==================================

- Join some rooms! Or create your own.
- Set a personal avatar.
- Add an email or phone number for recovery.
- Practise enabling encryption and comparing keys through another medium.
- Clean up your device keys in settings, logging in by browser can generate too many e2e keys.
- Try message the admin: ‘@PC-Admin:perthchat.org’
- Get your friends and family on Perthchat to complete the experience.


How do I browse more rooms?
===========================

On mobile select the ‘rooms’ category at the bottom, then open the ‘Room Directory’ dropdown. Select ‘matrix.org’ when prompted. The new room list will take about a minute to load so be patient.

You can also type in other known homeservers here.


I joined an encrypted room and now i'm being asked to verify?
=============================================================

Ideally end-to-end encryption requires users to verify each others keys, although this isn't strictly required.

**Do not click the 'verify' button**, first call the person you are trying to perform this verification with using another medium. (eg: phone/facebook) Then attempt the verification.

If you don't want to call them and are feeling a bit lazy, click 'send anyway', there is no point in you attempting verification if you don't first contact that person through another medium.


Can I donate or help?
=====================

Sure, the service costs about $200 USD a year to run, some help paying for it would be great:
